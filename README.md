# 🖼️ Background Removal App

A full-stack **Background Removal App** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
This app allows users to upload an image, automatically remove its background, and download the result.  
Authentication is handled using **Clerk**, and custom **REST APIs** process image uploads and background removal.
